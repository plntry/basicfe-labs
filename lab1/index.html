                    Mohyliv-Podilskyi is a city in the Mohyliv-Podilskyi Raion of the Vinnytsia
                    Oblast, Ukraine. Administratively, Mohyliv-Podilskyi is incorporated as a
                    town of regional significance. It also serves as the administrative center of
                    Mohyliv-Podilskyi Raion, one of twenty-seven districts of Vinnytsia Oblast,
                    though it is not a part of the district. It is located in the historic region
                    of Podolia, on the border with Bessarabia, Moldova, along the left bank of the
                    Dniester river. On the opposite side of the river lies the Moldovan town of
                    Otaci, and the two municipalities are connected to each other by a bridge.

                    The first mention of the town dates from 1595. The owner of the town,
                    Moldavian hospodar Ieremia Movilă (from which the name Mohyliv, Moghilău/Movilău
                    in Romanian) bestowed it as a dowry gift to his daughter, who married into
                    the Potocki family of Polish nobility. At that time, the groom named the town
                    Movilǎu in honor of his father-in-law. In the first quarter of the 17th century,
                    Mohyliv became one of the largest towns in Podolia. It was part of the Podolian
                    Voivodeship of the Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown. It was a multi-ethnic
                    border town composed of Poles, Greeks, Armenians, Serbs, Vlachs and Bosniaks.
                    In the 18th century the main churches of the town were built: the Polish-Armenian
                    Church of the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the Greek St. Nicholas
                    Church. Polish rule was interrupted by Ottoman rule as part of Podolia Eyalet.
                    During Ottoman rule, it was nahiya centre of Kamaniçe sanjak as Mihaylov.
